<p>Hi this was my first time using PHP... and really HTML, and originally was supposed to be integrated into a SugarCRM module. Unfortunately SugarCRM blacklists important functions in its module loader so installing such a module on a Sugarondemand server became impossible for someone like me.</p>

<p>The point is to autopopulate an existing PDF file with personal information. Say I have a form that I have to fill 500 times but with different information each time. As long as I have a file that denotes word placement I can use this to fill out the form efficiently.</p>

<p>Please read the Directions tab. As an afterthought the jQuery on this page was done by a friend.</p>
