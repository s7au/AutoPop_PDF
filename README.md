# AutoPop_PDF
Hi, this is a fairly basic PDF autopopulater. This was initially tested on LAMP. If you decide to clone it make sure your php.ini has file upload enabled. This ONLY autopopulates PDF's using txt file templates; nothing else. To see the code in action check it out here : http://shawn0.com/pdfautopopulator.
